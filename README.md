# Banking_in_python

Hello buddies!!

I have created a console based banking in python program. Here you can create new account, will be able to make changes. deposit and withdrawal function are also available.

The whole program is console based and also, all of the data is stored in the excel file which is in format(.xlsx) Also, the required modules which I have used in the project is mentioned in he requirements.txt. Furthermore, if you wat the rough idea of the whole project, then you can get it from outline.txt

Whole code is divided in different formats and it is free to use....

Enjoy.......
